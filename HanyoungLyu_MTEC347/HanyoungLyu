1. Ambient SynthDef

Main idea:
A sustained generative tone built with LFO-based modulation, low-pass filtering, delay, and reverb.

Signal Flow:

Saw oscillator → LFO amplitude modulation → Envelope shaping → RLPF → Comb delay → Reverb → Stereo panning


Key components:

SinOsc.kr(0.1) – slow LFO controlling amplitude fluctuation

Saw.ar(200 * SinOsc.kr(0.05).range(0.5, 2)) – frequency-modulated saw wave

Env.asr(0.01, 1, 4) – attack–sustain–release envelope triggered by a gate

RLPF.ar(..., MouseX.kr, MouseY.kr) – real-time filter control via mouse position

CombC.ar(...) – subtle echo creating motion and density

FreeVerb.ar(...) – stereo reverb adding spatial depth

LFNoise2.kr(0.1) – slow panning motion across stereo field

2. ChoirLayer SynthDef

Main idea:
A processed audio texture using a choir sample (Choir_A.wav) that loops and spatially evolves.

Signal Flow:

PlayBuf (sample playback) → RLPF → CombC delay → FreeVerb2 → Random panning


Key components:

PlayBuf.ar(2, buf, BufRateScale.kr(buf) * rate, loop:1) – stereo looping playback

RLPF.ar(...) – dynamic low-pass filtering using mouse X/Y

CombC.ar(...) – echo/delay for rhythmic depth

FreeVerb2.ar(...) – stereo reverb simulation

LFNoise2.kr(0.08) – random stereo position movement


3. Control and Performance

Mouse X → controls filter cutoff frequency (brightness)

Mouse Y → controls filter resonance (texture sharpness)

The Ambient layer sustains until x.set(\gate, 0) is triggered.

The ChoirLayer loops indefinitely until manually freed.
